# FeetAnalysis
Through images of a foot, the precision analysis is made on the sole of the foot. And you can see the different marches depending on the foot.
This repository contains several files. The main one is index.m, since this is the one that performs the analysis of the images of the march.
And the results obtained are obtained in the excel files, shown at the beginning.
The program begins to read the proposed images, later converts them to black and white, and cuts the image by sections according to the moment of the march.
After it shows the graph of pressure by section of each part of the march.
The iteration of the data is carried out and they are sent to an arduino board so that it can be repeated through leds.
